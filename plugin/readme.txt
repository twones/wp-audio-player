Highly configurable single track mp3 player.

== Description ==



== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the 'audio-player' folder and all it's contents to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Options' menu in WordPress to configure and customise the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can Audio Player play other formats than mp3? =

No. Audio Player uses Adobe Flash Player which can only play mp3 files.

= Can Audio Player play mp3 streams? =

Yes and No. Audio Player is not designed to play streams but sometimes it works. Browser support is also very patchy. I do not recommend you use Audio Player for mp3 streams.

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
